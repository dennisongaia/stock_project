    "Because of my lack of expertise when it comes to the stock market, I thought using machine learning might be a better approach, rather than manually trying to interpret complex technical indicators like I did last week. This week I began refreshing my Tensorflow knowledge, and based on many articles that I read this week (such as this: https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2019/reports/26254244.pdf) I decided to work on creating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent neural network, as it is used for time series forecasting. I began by getting data using yahoo_fin and working on preprocessing it. By next week I hope to have built and trained my model so that I can start implementing my new technique. For my trades this week I reutilized my technical indicator approach from last week.  "
